<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello everyone! I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Carbon Neutrality Science and Technology in the major of Energy and Environment at Southeast University. As first author, I have published more than ten papers in journals such as Annals of Operations Research, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, Nonlinear Dynamics, Journal of Environmental Management, Chaos, Solitons & Fractals, Journal of Forecasting, and International Review of Economics & Finance. Additionally, I have participated in multiple projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Jiangsu Provincial Social Science Foundation (Major).

My research interests include:
- Platform Economy
- Carbon Neutrality
- Time Series Forecasting
- Nonlinear Systems
- Complex Networks
