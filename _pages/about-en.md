<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello everyone,

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Carbon Neutrality Science and Technology at the School of Energy and Environment, Southeast University. As the first author, I have published over ten papers in prestigious journals, including *Annals of Operations Research*, *IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management*, *Nonlinear Dynamics*, *Journal of Environmental Management*, *Chaos, Solitons & Fractals*, *Journal of Forecasting*, and *International Review of Economics & Finance*. Additionally, I have participated in multiple projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and major grants from the Jiangsu Provincial Social Science Foundation.

My research interests include:
- Platform Economy
- Carbon Neutrality
- Time Series Forecasting
- Nonlinear Systems
- Complex Networks
